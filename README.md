I developed this website at Sicredi Integração PR/SC to store and share information about the various automation scripts that were in production. They have allowed me to make this public repository after removing any sensible information from the site.

The idea for this website came after maintaining for a couple months an old website that had been created for the same purpose. That website had several problems in its design, structure and acessibility. 

That motivated me to create a new one with good practices in mind and modern CSS (flexbox) syntax, while also following the design guidelines of the company. 

Developing this website helped me a lot in learning how to work with HTML, CSS, Javascript and several other web tools. 

It also led me to check out frameworks such as Tailwind CSS, React and Angular, which I'm studying at the moment. :saxophone:
